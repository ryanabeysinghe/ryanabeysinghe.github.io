    "Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The first case of COVID-19 was reported on December 1, 2019. COVID-19 began at the beginning of December 2019 near Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The cause of the pandemic was due to a new coronavirus, later called SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is of animal origin, with genetic similarity to bat coronaviruses, thought to result from a bat virome (bat-borne virus) <strong> [1] </strong>. In the past, outbreaks of some infectious diseases have been attributed to viruses from birds, pigs, and other animals that are lethal to humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people infected with the virus develop mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without the need for special treatment. However, some people become severely ill and need to see a doctor immediately, or within a few days of contracting symptoms. The Elderly and individuals with underlying disorders such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory illness, and cancer are more likely to contract serious illnesses, so they are at high-risk of acquire coronavirus <strong> [2]</strong>. Anyone is able to become infected with COVID-19, become seriously ill, or die. Although, the rate of contraction in younger individuals tend to persist much less.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to prevent and delay transmission of Coronavirus is to be well informed about how the virus is spreading. The virus is able to be spread by small particles of liquid as an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, or breathes through their mouth or nose.  To protect yourself and others from infection, it is advised to stay at least six feet away from others, wear a properly-fitting mask, wash your hands frequently, use hand sanitizer or alcohol-based rubbing. Receiving a vaccine is highly recommended to fight against being infected with the Coronavirus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, there is much uncertainty and misinformation being spread. In this final tutorial, we decided to address the importance of diet and maintaining a healthy lifestyle to lessen the risk of contracting COVID-19. Utilizing worldwide demographics and data, we seek to illustrate through information extraction, visual creativity, and statistical patterns to prove if having a healthier diet will increase the chances of survival against COVID-19. Through Data Science techniques such as Python regression analysis, null-hypothesis testing, and exploratory data analysis, we are determined to prove and disprove popular assumptions as to whether certain factors regarding the health of the individual affect COVID-19 mortality rates. The following variables will be utilized to prove our hypothesis: Obesity, Undernourishment, Vegetable consumption, Treenut consumption, and Fruits-Excluding Wine consumption.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To know more about the topics throughout the tutorial, we have links to various sources that are specified by bracketed numbers. These numbers are from the Works Cited Section at the bottom of our Tutorial. The sources provide various information regarding Covid-19 origins and its high risk populations, along with the benefits or drawbacks to certain types of diets outlined in the argument of the Tutorial.\n",

    "Obesity continues to be one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide. In most circumstances, people may become obese due to a poor nutritional diet. \"Obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally, with at least 2.9 million people dying each year as a result of being overweight or obese\" [3]. As previously mentioned, COVID-19 is a infectious respiratory disease. It is probable to expect that individuals with poor nutritional diets, possibly consisting of individuals who suffer from obesity or in the overweight category would be at greater risk of infection and death. To test whether there is a correlation between obesity and COVID-19 deaths, we took the obesity rates of various countries and compared them to the number of COVID-19 deaths of each country, performing a linear regression on the plot. The reason behind using a linear regression is because if there is a correlation, a linear relation is clearly illustrated. Below are the results of our calculations regarding the linear relationship between Obesity and COVID-19 deaths. \n",

Lastly, we have provided OLS regression results that stem from data from the table we created above. As you can see, we determined the p-value from the results of our calculations. The p-value for a statistical model is the probability that when the null hypothesis is true, the statistical summary is equal to or greater than the actual observed results. In this case, the p-value we calculated is <strong> 0.00000000006530504174828157 </strong>. Subsequently, this value is <strong> less than 0.05 </strong>, which infers that it is statistically significant. It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than a 5% probability that the null hypothesis is correct. Therefore, we <strong> REJECT </strong> the null hypothesis and <strong> ACCEPT the alternative hypothesis </strong>, which concludes that there is a significant correlation between obesity rates and COVID-19 deaths in each country globally from our dataset.\n",

    "<font size = \"5\"> <strong>Evaluation #2: Does Undernourishment Lead To An Increased Chance Of Death From COVID-19? </strong> </font>\n",
    "***\n",
    "Undernourishment continues to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide. \"Poor nutrition and hunger is responsible for the death of 3.1 million children a year. That's nearly half of all deaths in children under the age of 5. Globally, 822 million people suffer from undernourishment\" (The World Counts). As previously mentioned above, COVID-19 is a infectious respiratory disease, so one would expect that people with poor nutritional diets who result in undernourishment would be at greater risk of infection and death. To test whether there is or is not a correlation between undernourishment and COVID-19 deaths, we took the undernourished rates of various countries and compared them to the number of COVID-19 deaths of each country and performed a linear regression on the plot. We used a linear regression because if there was a correlation, it would intuitively be a linear relation. As shown below, these are the result of our calculations regarding undernourishment and COVID-19 deaths.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Null Hypothesis:</strong> Undernourishment rates have no correlation between undernourishment and COVID-19 deaths around the world for each country in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "<strong>Alternate Hypothesis:</strong> Undernourishment rates have a strong significant correlation between undernourishment and COVID-19 deaths around the world for each country. "

    "We have provided a table illustrating the data on undernourishment rates and COVID-19 deaths in various different countries around the world. Additionally, we have provided a scatter plot which illustrates the relation between undernourishment rates and COVID-19 deaths. Lastly, we have provided OLS regression results that stem from data from the table we created above. As you can see, we determined the p-value from the results of our calculations. The p-value for a statistical model is the probability that when the null hypothesis is true, the statistical summary is equal to or greater than the actual observed results. In this case, the p-value we calculated is <strong> 0.00000002243538027485908 </strong>. Subsequently, this value is <strong> less than 0.05 </strong>, which infers that it is statistically significant. It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than a 5% probability that the null hypothesis is correct. Therefore, we <strong> REJECT </strong> the null hypothesis and <strong> ACCEPT the alternative hypothesis </strong>, which concludes that there is a significant correlation between undernourishment rates and COVID-19 deaths in each country around the world from our dataset.\n",

    "Consuming nutritious meals is one meaningful way to elevate one's immune system. Vegetables are high in vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. Additionally, they provide nutrients such as beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E, which can boost immune function. As previously mentioned above, COVID-19 is a infectious respiratory disease, so one would expect that people with great nutritional diets who result in vast vegetable consumption would be at lesser risk of infection and death. Is this true or does the COVID-19 virus make no difference on the type of diet someone is on? To test whether there is or is not a correlation between vegetable consumption and COVID-19 deaths, we took the vegetable consumption rates of various countries and compared them to the number of COVID-19 deaths of each country and performed a linear regression on the plot. We used a linear regression because if there was a correlation, it would intuitively be a linear relation. As shown below, these are the result of our calculations regarding vegetable consumption and COVID-19 deaths.\n",

    "We have provided a table illustrating the data between vegetable consumption rates and COVID-19 deaths in various different countries around the world. Additionally, we have provided a scatter plot which illustrates the relation between vegetable consumption rates and COVID-19 deaths. Lastly, we have provided OLS regression results that stem from data from the table we created above. As you can see, we determined the p-value from the results of our calculations. The p-value for a statistical model is the probability that when the null hypothesis is true, the statistical summary is equal to or greater than the actual observed results. In this case, the p-value we calculated above is <strong>0.9453309860444901</strong>. Subsequently, this value is <strong> greater than 0.05 </strong>, which infers that it is statistically <strong>NOT</strong> significant. It indicates no strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is greater than a 5% probability that the null hypothesis is correct. Therefore, we <strong>FAILED</strong> to reject the null hypothesis and <strong>ACCEPT the null hypothesis</strong>, which concludes that there is <strong>NOT</strong> a significant correlation between vegetable consumption rates and COVID-19 deaths in each country around the world from our dataset. Therefore since we <strong>fail to reject the null hypothesis</strong> stated above. Eating vegetables does indeed help support our immune system which will help us fight against the COVID-19 virus. \n",

    "Treenuts are widely eaten as a snack food or used in cooking. They are a great source of nutrients, loaded with antioxidants that may aid weight loss, may lower cholestrol and triglycerides, may reduce inflammation, high in beneficial fiber, and improve heart health and immune functions. As previously mentioned above, COVID-19 is a infectious respiratory disease, so one would expect that people with great nutritional diets who result in vast treenut consumption would be at lesser risk of infection and death. Would consuming treenuts for a healthier diet help fight against the COVID-19 virus? To test whether there is or is not a correlation between treenut consumption and COVID-19 deaths, we took the treenut consumption rates of various countries and compared them to the number of COVID-19 deaths of each country and performed a linear regression on the plot. We used a linear regression because if there was a correlation, it would intuitively be a linear relation. As shown below, these are the result of our calculations regarding treenut consumption and COVID-19 deaths.\n",

    "We have provided a table illustrating the data between treenut consumption rates and COVID-19 deaths in various different countries around the world. Additionally, we have provided a scatter plot which illustrates the relation between treenut consumption rates and COVID-19 deaths. Lastly, we have provided OLS regression results that stem from data from the table we created above. As you can see, we determined the p-value from the results of our calculations. The p-value for a statistical model is the probability that when the null hypothesis is true, the statistical summary is equal to or greater than the actual observed results. In this case, the p-value we calculated above is <strong>0.04798943887205049</strong>. Subsequently, this value is <strong>less than 0.05</strong>, which infers that it is statistically significant. It indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is less than a 5% probability that the null hypothesis is correct. Therefore, we <strong>REJECT the null hypothesis</strong> and <strong>ACCEPT the alternate hypothesis</strong>, which concludes that there is a correlation between treenut consumption rates and COVID-19 deaths in each country around the world from our dataset. Therefore since we reject the null hypothesis stated above; eating treenuts does indeed help support our immune system, cholesterol levels, and improve heart health but it is not an efficient food group to eat in order to fight against the COVID-19 virus. Additionally, when observing the p-value, it is very close to 0.05, which illustrates that it is still a great food source to help fight against COVID-19, it is just not as effective as consuming vegetables which is shown during evaluation #3. \n",

    "Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber. Additionally, fruits provide a wide range of health-boosting antixidants, including flavonoids. Consuming a diet high in fruits can reduce our risk of developing heart disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes to help support a healthy immune system. As previously mentioned above, COVID-19 is a infectious respiratory disease, so one would expect that people with great nutritional diets who result in vast fruit consumption would be at lesser risk of infection and death. Would consuming fruits for a healthier diet help fight against the COVID-19 virus? To test whether there is or is not a correlation between fruit consumption and COVID-19 deaths, we took the fruit consumption rates of various countries and compared them to the number of COVID-19 deaths of each country and performed a linear regression on the plot. We used a linear regression because if there was a correlation, it would intuitively be a linear relation. As shown below, these are the result of our calculations between fruit consumption and COVID-19 deaths.\n",

    "We have provided a table illustrating the data between Fruit consumption rates (excluding wine) and COVID-19 deaths in various different countries around the world. Additionally, we have provided a scatter plot which illustrates the relation between fruit consumption rates and COVID-19 deaths. Lastly, we have provided OLS regression results that stem from data from the table we created above. As you can see, we determined the p-value from the results of our calculations. The p-value for a statistical model is the probability that when the null hypothesis is true, the statistical summary is equal to or greater than the actual observed results. In this case, the p-value we calculated above is <strong>0.19848679481002798</strong>. Subsequently, this value is <strong>greater than 0.05</strong>, which infers that it is statistically <strong>NOT</strong> significant. It indicates no strong evidence against the null hypothesis, as there is greater than a 5% probability that the null hypothesis is correct. Therefore, we <strong>FAILED</strong> to reject the null hypothesis and instead <strong>ACCEPT the null hypothesis</strong>, which concludes that there is <strong>NOT</strong> a significant correlation between fruit consumption rates and COVID-19 deaths in each country around the world from our dataset. Therefore since we fail to reject the null hypothesis stated above; eating fruits does indeed help support our immune system which will help us fight against the COVID-19 virus. \n",

    "To visually display the data, we want to explore the violin plot for Covid-19 Deaths and a Cloropleth map displaying the death rate of each country in our dataset. This initial representation of the data will allow us to gain some initial assumptions about where the most Covid-Deaths ocurred, and where they are locationally to exhibit where these countries are in terms of regions and continents. This will help us later as we analyze region and continent data."

    "The above violin plot exhibits a consistent pattern similar to the chloropleth map that we observed previously. Before, we saw that North and South America and Europe had the highest Covid-19 Death Rates overall, while the Middle East, North Africa, Greater Arabia; Sub-Saharan Africa; Central America and the Caribbean; Australia and Oceania; and Asia had the lowest Covid-19 Death Rates. In this plot, we can see that Europe, South America, and North America have the highest medians and longest range (highest highs) of Covid-19 deaths compared to the other regions. Comparably, we can observe that the Middle East, North Africa, Greater Arabia; Sub-Saharan Africa; Central America and the Caribbean; Australia and Oceania; and Asia had the lowest lows of Covid-19 deaths compared to other regions. Let's keep this distribution over these regions in mind as we explore the food features of our dataset."

In this plot, we can see that Europe and the Americas have the highest medians and longest range (highest highs) of Covid-19 deaths compared to the other continents. Comparably, we can observe that the Africa, Asia, and Ocenia have the (lowest lows) of Covid-19 deaths compard to other continents.

    "After performing regression analysis, hypothesis testing, and exploratory data analysis, we were able to determine whether or not <strong> Obesity, Undernourishment, Vegetable consumption, Treenut consumption, and Fruits-Excluding Wine consumption </strong> are directly correlated to COVID-19 death rates. The results of our calculations are shown below: \n",

    "In exploring the regions and continents of the world, we discovered some interesting patterns when observing different features of the datasets including: Covid-19 Deaths, Obesity, Meat, Animal Products, and Vegetables. We found that the highest Covid-19 Death regions were Europe, North America, and South America, the highest Covid-19 Death continents were Europe and the Americas after viewing the initial death rate violin plots. We found that the lowest Covid-19 Death regions were Asia; Australia, Oceania; Central America, Caribbean; Middle East, North Africa, Greater Arabia; and Sub-Saharan Africa, the lowest Covid-19 Death conitnents were Asia, Africa and Oceania. This trend continued as we observed the violin plots for the mentioned features of the dataset related to diet: Meat, Animal Products, and Vegetables. Noticeably, food diets consisting of a higher percentage of Vegetables contributed to healthier diets, contributing to a persistent decrease in deaths between the regions and continents. On the other hand, food diets consisting of a higher percentage of Meat and Animal Products contributed to not as healthy diets, contributing to a persistent increase in deaths between the regions and continents. \n",

    "\n",
    "As we concluded the results of our calculations, we had already made assumptions about how Obesity, Undernourishment, Vegetable consumption, Treenut consumption, and Fruits-Excluding Wine consumption directly correlates to COVID-19 death rates. It is no surprise that there is a direct correlation between obesity and COVID-19 death rates. People who are obese may have underlying conditions such as type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, strokes, sleep apnea, and many other health problems which poses a higher risk of death if contracted with COVID-19. Additionally, there is also no suprise that there is a direct correlation between undernourishment and COVID-19 death rates. Undernourishment can cause fluid to build up in the abdomen, arms, and legs. Some types of white blood cells decrease, similar to what occurs in people with AIDS. As a result, the immune system is weakened, increasing the risk of infection. However, we are surprised that treenut consumption had a direct correlation to COVID-19 death rates. One would imagine that consuming treenuts would lessen the risks of dying from COVID-19 because of the nutritional benefits treenuts contain. Some of the benefits include unsaturated fats (specifically monosaturated and polysaturated fats) to lower cholesterol levels, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, vitamin E, plant sterols, and L-arginine. From our calculations provided above, the p-value of treenut consumption is almost greater than 0.05, which concludes that consuming treenuts is healthy for the immune system and provides nutritional benefits, but it is just not as an effective food source to help lessen the risks of death from COVID-19. Subsequently, we are not suprised that consuming vegetables and fruits-excluding wine would decrease the risks of death from COVID-19. It turns out that vegetables are important sources of many nutrients including potassium, dietary fiber, folate (folic acid), vitamin A, and vitamin C. Additionally, fruits are naturally low in fat, sodium, and calories. There is no cholesterol. Fruits are a good source of many essential nutrients, including potassium, dietary fiber, vitamin C, and folic acid (folic acid). A potassium-rich diet helps maintain normal blood pressure. Therefore, we were able to conclude that consuming vegetables and fruits help support the immune system and provide many nutritional benefits to lessen the risks of death from COVID-19. Maintaining a healthier diet that revolves around consuming vegetables and fruits, will help us fight against the COVID-19 virus."
